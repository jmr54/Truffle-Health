# Truffle-Health
Truffle Health internship
My project for Truffle Health. 
AFter installing the npm, can run npm run nodeStart to start the project. Since we did not have to use a database, I preloaded once in to show how the get request works. 
I used postman to insert JSON values that includes name, hospital name, date and the bill amount. There are also two test I did in order to show my get request.
Some images below

The picture below shows what it looks like after it requests to get all of the patients that are recorded. (http://localhost:3000/patient/patientList is the url to get the list)
