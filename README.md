# Truffle-Health
Truffle Health internship
My project for Truffle Health. 
AFter installing the npm, can run npm run nodeStart to start the project. Since we did not have to use a database, I preloaded once in to show how the get request works. 
I used postman to insert JSON values that includes name, hospital name, date and the bill amount.
